I am currently working as a researcher at [VITO](https://vito.be/en) Data Science Hub with a focus on high-performance computing, machine learning techniques, and AI software development.

As a data scientist with a background in computational physics, I have experience in scientific software development and optimization, machine learning, and molecular dynamics simulations. A team player who has accomplished several types of collaborative research some of which were published in high-impact scientific journals such as Nature.
