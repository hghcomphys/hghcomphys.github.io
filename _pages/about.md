I completed my Ph.D. in computational physics at [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) in Belgium.

I am currently working as a researcher at _Flemish Institute for Technological Research_ ([VITO](https://vito.be/en)), _Data Science Hub_, with a focus on 
* High-performance computing
* Machine learning techniques
* (AI) software development

<!-- As a data scientist with a background in computational physics, I have experience in scientific software development and optimization, machine learning, and molecular dynamics simulations. A team player who has accomplished several types of collaborative research some of which were published in high-impact scientific journals such as Nature. -->

[^structure]: See [**Structure** page]({{ "/docs/structure/" | relative_url }}) for a list of theme files and what they do.

**ProTip:** Be sure to remove `/docs` and `/test` if you forked Minimal Mistakes. These folders contain documentation and test pages for the theme and you probably don't want them littering up your repo.

**Note:** The theme uses the [jekyll-include-cache](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-include-cache) plugin which will need to be installed in your `Gemfile` and added to the `plugins` array of `_config.yml`. Otherwise you'll throw `Unknown tag 'include_cached'` errors at build.
