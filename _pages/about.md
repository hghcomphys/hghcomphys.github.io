My name is Hossein Ghorbanfekr. I am originally from [Rasht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasht) the capital city of _Gilan Province_, _Iran_. Also known as the "City of Rain".
Since 2015, I am living in [Antwerp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp), _Belgium_.

I did my Ph.D. in physics at [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/).
In the past, I conducted computational studies on structural and dynamical properties of nano-confined water in 2D-material membranes within the framework of machine learning molecular dynamics simulations.

I am currently working as a research data scientist at _Flemish Institute for Technological Research_ ([VITO](https://vito.be/en)), _Data Science Hub_, with a focus on High-performance computing, machine learning techniques, and AI software development.

That's pretty much all there is to know about me.

[^structure]: See [**Structure** page]({{ "/docs/structure/" | relative_url }}) for a list of theme files and what they do.

**ProTip:** Be sure to remove `/docs` and `/test` if you forked Minimal Mistakes. These folders contain documentation and test pages for the theme and you probably don't want them littering up your repo.

**Note:** The theme uses the [jekyll-include-cache](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-include-cache) plugin which will need to be installed in your `Gemfile` and added to the `plugins` array of `_config.yml`. Otherwise you'll throw `Unknown tag 'include_cached'` errors at build.
