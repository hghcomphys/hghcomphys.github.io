Here I shows my attempt to build a wireless _weather monitor_ module, using [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU) microcontroller, which connects to the internet via WiFi and pulling some useful weather status information from [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) let's say every 5 minutes.

For more details and the sketch (C++ source code) please see
