Here I will show my attempt to build a wireless _weather monitor_ module, using [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU) microcontroller, which connects to the internet via WiFi and pulling some useful weather status information from [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) let's say every 5 minutes.

#### Features
- Pulling data through wireless connection
- Various weather info are available including 
  - temperature, feels-like temperature, etc 
  - pressure, 
  - humidity
  - wind speed
  - visibility
- Temperature status indicator LEDs: 
  - Red (too hot)
  - green (normal)
  - blue (too cold)
- Weather indicator in case of extreme weather \
(e.g. rain or snow)
  - Yellow LED
  - Buzzer (single or double beep)
- Change texts color when the weather status is not normal \
(e.g. high wind speed, low visibility, rain) 
- Report date and time of the latest update using NTP client
